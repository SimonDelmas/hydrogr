Description: # pyGR
        
        pyGR is a python language software package for hydrological modelling, that implement several conceptual rainfall-runoff models (GR4H, GR4J, ~~GR5J~~\*, ~~GR6J~~\*, GR2M, GR1A, ~~Cemaneige~~\*).
        It is based on the Fortran implementation of these models, provided in the Irstea R language package: [airGR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/airGR/index.html).
        
        \* Not implemented yet.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        pyGR requires :
        
        * Python 3
        * [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for fortran integration and array manipulation.
        * [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for dataset and time series handling.
        * [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) for graphics.
        * (optional) [Spotpy](https://github.com/thouska/spotpy) for model calibration and evaluation.
        
        ### Installing
        
        To install the package, clone or download the repository and use the setup.py :
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Simon-Delmas/pyGR.git
        cd pyGR
        python ./setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Running the tests
        
        After installation, you can launch the test suite with pytest :
